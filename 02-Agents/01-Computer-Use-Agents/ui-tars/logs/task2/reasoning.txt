Thought:
I noticed that there are several icons in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, and the Calendar app is located in the first position on the left. To access the Calendar app and switch to the Year view, I need to click on this icon to open the app first.

Thought:
I just clicked on the Calendar app icon, and now I need to wait a moment for the app to finish loading. This process usually takes a few seconds, and during this time, I can see the loading animation on the screen. Once the app is fully opened, I will be able to proceed with the next step of switching to the Year view.
Parsed action:
{"type": "wait"}

Thought:
The Calendar app has finally finished loading, and I can see the interface clearly now. To switch to the Year view, I need to locate the "Year" button in the top menu bar. It's positioned right next to the "Month" button, and by clicking on it, I can change the display mode to Year view.

Thought:
I checked the current interface, and the Calendar app is indeed displaying the Year view. The calendar for 2025 is fully visible, with each month clearly laid out. The task of switching to the Year view has been successfully completed, and I can now confirm that the task is finished.
Parsed action:
{"type": "finished", "content": "I have successfully switched to the Year view in the Calendar app."}
